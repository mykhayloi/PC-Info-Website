    <h1>Graphics Cards</h1>
    <div class="info">
    <p>Graphics Cards formerly known as GPUs are the most exciting part of building PCs. Companies are constantly coming out with new cards with improvements and they are the ones in charge of running your game. In short the better the graphics card the higher frame rate and smoother graphics you will get. There are a few things to look out for when purchasing a graphics card.

    <h2>Bandwidth</h2>
    <div class = "info">
    <p>Bandwidth is how fast your graphics takes information and draws it back on your screen. A lot of people mistakenly focus on the memory size of the graphics card but that is rarely needed to play. Bandwidth is calculated in GB/s and it is important for that to be high. 
        </p>

    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <div class = "info">
    <p>Compatibility is key and comes as a surprise to a lot of people. You always have to check if your graphics card can fit in your case. Most graphics cards on the market are compatible with most motherboards so you won’t have to worry about that. Furthermore do not think having two graphics cards automatically makes your game run twice as smooth. The fact is it will only increase performance by 25% to 50% and it is overkill. You might as well invest in a higher grade GPU instead of buying two mediocre cards.

    <h2>What To Look For</h2>
    <div class = "info">
    <p>Compare graphics cards online, there are plenty of websites that compare benchmark tests for thousands of graphics cards. In addition this make sure to see what games you play and decide what graphics card makes sense for you. Obviously it's everyone's dream to buy the best graphics card on the market. However, if you play games that are very well optimized or don’t need high end video cards, save your money and buy a less expensive graphics card.
