        Obviously a computer needs a monitor. When you are looking at monitors you have to take into account three things. First the monitors refresh rate. The refresh rate is how many frames the monitor can physically show. The only problem with buying a high Hz monitor is if your computer can not run games at that rate. If you can run a game at 60 frames there is no reason to buy a 120Hz monitor because you wonâ€™t be utilizing it. Second you have to look at color quality. Monitors vary on in quality of the color and it makes a big difference. Lastly, make sure to check how long your monitor will last. Some monitors will have more dead pixels appear over time and that should be considered when purchasing a monitor.

        <p>Furthermore, it is important to pick good headphones, keyboard and mouse. The problem with the all of these is they rely on person to person. Obviously you want the headphones with the best sound quality. However headphones fit each person's head differently so you need to see it for yourself. Same goes for keyboards and mice. Each mouse fits a hand differently.</p>
