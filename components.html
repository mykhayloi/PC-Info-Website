    <h1>Other Components</h1>
    <div class="info">
    <p>There are a few components that every computer needs but is not as important when researching what to buy. First there is RAM. RAM is absolutely necessary to store data that is being used currently. Currently the fastest RAM on the market is DDR5. The recommended amount is 16 GB but if you are trying to save money you could get away with just 8. Next you will need a power supply. For those who donâ€™t know, you need power to run a computer and they range from 100 watts to thousands watts. Most of the time you will need about 500 watts. If you are planning to overclock your PC you might need a little more. You can calculate how many watts you will need because every component tells you how much watts it will use. Make sure that you do not overspend on a power supply. You will also need memory. This comes in two forms. Hard drive and SSD. A hard drive is slower but can store more information. SSD are much faster for storing data but it costs much more. You should find a good balance in price and memory space. Lastly and probably the least important aspect is the CPU cooler. A lot of people focus on this but the reality is almost any CPU cooler on the market is good enough. And this wraps up for what to look out for when you are building a PC.</p>
