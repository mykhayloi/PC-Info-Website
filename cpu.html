        <h1>CPU</h1>
    <div class = "info">
    <p>CPUs are much less important when it comes to building gaming PCs. There are however a couple of things you should look out for. First of all, look out for compatibility. Unlike with GPUs not all motherboards fit all CPUs. Make sure that your CPU fits into your motherboard. When looking for quality you should look at GHz, which is the clock speed ,and the amount of cores.Lastly make sure that you donâ€™t bottleneck. Bottlenecking is when you have some components that are so much worse than others it cannot physically keep up. This means that higher quality components have to purposely lag behind and that obviously results in worse gameplay. You should try and buy your pieces to all be roughly the same quality to not waste money.
