        The logo seen next to PC Masterz was created in Adobe illustrator by myself. I embedded a lot of jpeg images as seen on every page. I also have a gif of corsair PC cases on the first page. I have a picture on every page except for this page. I have an image on on the page of peripherals a picture of a keyboard, mouse, and headphones. When you move your mouse on it, it shows the company that sells this, 'Hyper X'.
        
        What I happy with on this website is the menu bar sticks to the top when you scroll down. This allows for the navigation on this website to always be around. I also am happy with my logo because it is unique and no one has used it before. Lastly, I'm glad that I put navigation bars at the bottom to go to the 'next' or 'previous' page.
        
        What I could have done better was write more in depth information. I felt like I could not go more into depth because that would be for too much information. Furthermore, I would have liked to change my layout a little to have more information in one page. 
        
        My website is a good place to start when you are looking to build a PC. It does not have a bias because it does not promote any companies directly. It simply gets a person introduced to key words and phrases when shopping for computer parts. It does not go too into detail, however it does help beginners understand what to look for.
